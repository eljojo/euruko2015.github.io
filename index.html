<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4 class="faq-header">Why was there no vote?</h4>

<p>After canceling EuRuKo 2014 last year we thought about running an online vote, but the truth is — it's turned out to be faily hard to verify that signatures are real. There would be so many grey areas that many of you wouldn't believe in this voting (we wouldn't).</p>
<p>Historically, teams presented their cities during the conference but with online vote you wouldn't know the team and the people behind the next year's conference.</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">Who's organising EuRuKo 2015?</h4>

<p>EuRuKo 2015 is organised by the Ukrainian-based EuRuKo 2014 team (Vlad, Natalia and Julia) with support from other European Ruby associations, including Ruby Berlin e.V. (the organisers of EuRuKo 2011 and eurucamp).</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">Why Salzburg, Austria?</h4>

<p>As you probably remember, we've had to cancel EuRuKo 2014 in Kiev because we couldn't guarantee safety to all and every attendee, which is still the case.</p>
<p>We evaluated five beautiful cities and Salzburg won the vote. We think that it's a great choice for a conference like EuRuKo and just a fantastic place to spend some time at.</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">When Call for Papers will be open?</h4>

<p>We're going to open Call for Papers in March. We are going to try something new, so stay tuned!</p>

<h4 class="faq-header">Will there be a Code of Conduct?</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>
